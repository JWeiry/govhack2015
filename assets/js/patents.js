    'image':'first_patent_improved_air_brake.png',
    'desctext':'I, ANDREW BROWN MCKENZIE, Of 20 Harold Street, South Melbourne, in the State of Victoria, Comnmonwealth of Australia, Shipwright, hereby declare this invention, and the manner in which it is to be performed, to be fully described and ascertained in and by the following statement:- A number of serious accidents have occurred in connection with the use of the Westinghouse brake, and from long experience in the railway service I have ascertained one cause of such accidents and have devised the present means of overcoming it with extreme simplicity and economy. At each end of each railway carriage and at each end of the locomotive there is a lever to turn on and off a cock which allows (or prevents) the passage of air. This lever is at all times in an extraordinarily exposed, unprotected and dangerous position considering how easily it might be operated, and how great is the amount of life and property dependent upon its retaining its correct position.',

'title':'Black Box Flight Data Recorder',
'patentno':'1985039903',
'image':'black_box_flight_data_recorder.png',
'desctext':'A data acquisition system (18) for use in an aircraft flight data recorder (10) receives multiple analog f, 12) and discrete signals (14) representative of various aircraft parameters. A single address command from the fligth data recorder central processing unit (CPU) (24) causes a irst multiplexer (56) to select a set or analog signals. Each selected analog signal is amplified (61, 62, 63) by a gain factor under CPU (24) control and passed to track-and-hold circuitry 7 1, 72, 73) which holds a level of the amplified analog signal upon receipt of a suitable command. The held analog signal levels are passed to a second multiplexer (80) which also receives a set of discrete signals selected by a third multiplexer (84) in response to a CPU (24)%ddress command, A control sequencer (96) sequentially passes each signal at the input of the second multiplexer (80) through an analog-tb-digital converter (90) with the resultant digital signal being loaded into memory (92). After either all the selected and processed analog signals or the selected discrete signals have been analog-to-diegital converted  and stored in memory, the control, sequencer (96) issues an interrupt signal to the CPU t(24).'},

'patentno':'1982085668',
'image':'winged_keel.png',
'desctext':'The present invention relates to a sailing yacht with, as usual, a keel below the hull. Such a keel has the function to improve the stability of the yacht and its windwardsailing performance by producing a hydrodynamic side force opposing the side force on the sails, thereby preventing the yacht from makin leeway. V Tihe present invention aims to further improve the side force and lift characteristics of the keel.',

'patentno':'1956016938',
'desctext':'"AN IMPROVED FOLD- AWAY HANDLE FOR CLOTHES HOISTS OR THE LIKE". The following statement is a full description of the invention, including the best method of performing it known to us: This invention relates to an improved fold-away handle for clothes hoists, or the like. Clothes hoists are usually operated by turning a handle which is coupled to the raising and Lowering mechanism. It is sometimes desirable to be able to lock the hoists against raising and lowering to prevent smaller children from operating them and we have found that this can best be achieved by so arranging the handle that it can be turned to bring it into a plane where it can no longer be revolved in that the grip will strike the standard or other part of the hoist.'
